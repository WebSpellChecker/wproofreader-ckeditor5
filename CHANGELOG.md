## 2.0.0 – 2020-12-16

* Added a WProofreader button with a dropdown menu to the CKEditor 5 toolbar where users can access settings, open proofread in dialog mode or turn the functionality on/off. All those action items were moved from the floating badge.
* The badge is kept there to indicate a number of errors found and show the progress of text checking (loader). If the plugin is in the disabled state (off), the badge will be hidden.
* Implemented synchronization of the plugin state in the case of the CKEditor 5 multi-root mode.

The new version of the plugin is compatible with [WebSpellChecker v5.8.0](https://webspellchecker.com/release-notes/v5-8-0/) and higher.

This is a pilot version of the WProofreader plugin for CKEditor 5. The main differences between plugin and classic WProofreader are:

* Shipped and configured as a plugin for CKEditor 5.
* Tailored theme based on styles of CKEditor 5.
* Compatible with the [multi-root editor](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/examples/framework/multi-root-editor.html).
* Automatically disabled the dialog mode of WProofreader when the real-time collaboration features or multi-root editor are turned on.
